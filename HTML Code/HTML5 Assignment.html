   <h1> The Dusky Page</h1>

   <main> <h2> This is a page about our darling black cat, Dusk (aka Dusky), who we adopted from a homeless shelter in 2020 during the covid pandemic. </h2> 

    <aside> <i> We live in Melbourne and spent an awful lot of time in lockdown, so it seemed like a good time for a new pet. </i> </aside>

    <p>Dusk's start in life wasn't easy. The RSPCA rescued his litter from someone who tortured them, and thought the litter might need to be 'destroyed' as they were in such bad shape physically and mentally. Cheltenham Cat Shelter intervened and asked to be given a chance to rehabilitate the litter, and the rest is history. (If you would like to get information about adopting a cat or kitten in Australia, please click <a href="https://www.rspca.org.au/adopt/adopting-a-cat-or-kitten/" >here</a> to get information from the RSPCA. <br> <br>

    Dusk is strictly a housebound cat, and we are sure he has no street smarts whatsoever. He is perfectly content to stay inside, although he does enjoy sitting on the couch and watching the street out the window. <br> <br>

    Dusk is an extremely shy cat, and disappears the moment he senses a stranger in the house. He will also bolt the moment he hears a loud noise or anyone moves too quickly. However, he is also an extremely tolderant cat who will endure hours of being held by my daughters in whatever position they choose to place him. He also enjoys a cuddle with his people, and will cuddle into you, tucking his head into your neck if the opportunity allows. He also enjoys burrowing under the bedsheets on cold nights with one of the girls or with me - very cute. <br> <br>

    Poor Dusk has had to have 8 teeth removed, including his top fangs. The vet advised this wasn't uncommon amongst rescue cats who may have had viruses before being rescued, which in turn can negatively impact the health of their teeth. He is much happier though without the teeth that were causing him pain. He now regularly looks quite goofy as his tongue often flops outside his mouth. <br> <br>

    Below are some pictures of our Dusky boy. </p>
